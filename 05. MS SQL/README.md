# MS SQL

The intensive database fundamentals course introduce us to one of the most widely used database management systems (DBMS) used in the development of modern information systems - Microsoft SQL Server. The course focuses heavily on the relational model, data modeling with ER diagrams (tables and relational relationships) and working with the SQL language (data extraction, selection, projection, joins, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion and insertion). Provides fundamental knowledge of working with ACID transactions and transaction processing, and practical tips for performance tuning. This course lays the foundations of working with databases, making it easier to use them in real-world applications and to understand concepts such as converting a database into an object-oriented model (ORM).
