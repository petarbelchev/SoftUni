# C# OOP

The "C# OOP" course teach us the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), working with classes and objects, using object-oriented modeling, and building class hierarchies. Basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism has be studied. We go into the most commonly used design patterns (creational, structural and behavioral design patterns). We have been introduced to SOLID principles for object-oriented software design. We look at various debugging techniques. We learn how to create and use decorators. We focus on unit testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).
