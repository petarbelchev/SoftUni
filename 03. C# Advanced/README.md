# C# Advanced

The "C# Advanced" course builds on the skills of working with the C# language and the .NET platform by looking at more complex concepts typical for the language. In the course we learned how to create linear data structures, solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), work with streams, files and directories, create template classes. Attention is paid to the functional programming paradigm, as well as to the main tool based on it - LINQ for processing data flows. The development environment that will be used by the training team is Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, but each trainee is free to use tools of preference.
